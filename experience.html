	<h1><i>My Experience</h1></i>
	<p>I even did not know what to write here. But I would like to tell a story. Starting a life at a boarding school offers many positive experiences. Leaving for boarding school on 13 years-old was one of the hardest moments of my life. It was terrifying, leaving home, and everything that provided me with the comfort and warmth, and to go somewhere where I knew no one. I was going to start from scratch with no friends and nobody I knew. It was going to be a challenge for me, and I realized quickly that I had mixed feelings for going away to school. I tried to be positive about the situation, but as my first day of boarding school was approaching, I began to have less and less confidence at the thought of leaving my hometown and losing the identity that I already had. On 08 February 2012, I started my journey to MRSM Jeli, which was located in Kelantan.</p>
	<p>But, today, it makes me realize that I am having so much fun there. At boarding school, I learn about life, friendship, love, sacrifation, hard-work, independence and many more. Boarding school teach me to be better me. I learn to make decisions by myself. After I graduated from boarding school, I know where I want to go.  </p>
	<p>I want to gain lots of new experience. As I love money so much, one way for me to gain new experience and at the same time earn some money, I decided to do part-time job. Let's look on the list of my part-time job: </p>
